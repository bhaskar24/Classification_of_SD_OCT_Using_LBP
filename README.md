## Folder Structures

## Preprocessing
NLMVolume.m
Will do NLM on whole volume and write _NLM denoised file in other file.
```
NLM.m----> For NLM of each frame individually
				bound_extension.m----> For extending/mirroring boundary pixels for NLM
				GetPSNR and psdnoise.m----> For calculating PSNR value
```
flattenVolume.m
LBPVolume.m

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Preprocessing: Following Folder contains following directory Struture:
--------NLMVolume.m
----------------Will do NLM on whole volume and write _NLM denoised file in other file.
		Required files: NLM.m----> For NLM of each frame individually
				bound_extension.m----> For extending/mirroring boundary pixels for NLM
				GetPSNR and psdnoise.m----> For calculating PSNR value
				
--------flattenVolume.m
---------------Will do image flattening and Alignement of  each frames in whole volume and write _FA in other file.
		Required files: flatten.m----> For flattening and aligning of each frames
				ployRegression.m----> For polynomial regression of degree 2 for smooth curve.
				oct_align.m----> For cropping of only neceesary portion.

LBP:
--------LBPVolume.m
---------------Will extract features and labels from each frames individually and gives labels to each frame from grader.mat file.
		Required files: LBPFrame.m----> LBP of each individual frames.
				efficientLBP.m----> For calculting LBP in (8,1) mode.
				generateRadialFilter.m----> For generating radius filter of (8,1).
				UniformLBP8.txt----> For mapping of labels in (8,1) mode.
				ExtractLables.m----> For extracting Features and Labels from whole volume.
Classification:
---------TestKNN.m
--------------On given mat files, will train the model and give last mat file as test cae to it and will show how much incorrect values it got.
		Required files: KNN.m----> Will take value of k as argument and gives trained model

As per our project, we were able to achieve 80% Sensitivity and 100% Specificity.

Dataset:
Link: https://mirror.nitk.ac.in/owncloud/index.php/s/ZRxtIDWsMJjXATe (will work in NITK intranet only).
----------------> NLM Data-> contains volume already denoised with NLM.
----------------> Flattening+Align Data -> After NLM, Flattening and alignment, volumes are stored here.
----------------> LBP Data-> After NLM,Flattening, Aligning and LBP Feature Extraction data is stored here.
